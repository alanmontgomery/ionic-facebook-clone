# ionic-facebook-clone

## The only UI parts available in this clone are;
* The timeline with post examples
* Messenger UI (list of chats only) - this is also linked to the "message bubble" top-right

### Included in this example
* Icons in toolbar
* Sub-page route unrelated to tab to hide tab bar
* Custom CSS and SASS

Alternatively, you can add the iOS, Android platform and run natively.
